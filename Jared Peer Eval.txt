Peer Eval for TJ Boyle 

As per usual TJ was a great teammate, yet again if there was a scale I would give him a 10 out of 10, 10 being the highest... 
I have no complaints about working with him and I would gladly work with him again, and likely will.
He was good to bounce ideas off of and we hardly ever disagreed with the direction we should be going on the homework.
In my opinion we did equal amounts of work and always worked together in the lab so the work was even.
